                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>On April 27th, a massive storm outbreak hit the southeast United States producing numerous tornadoes and damage. In the middle of this crisis, Whiteboard built a prototype devoted to needs awareness and response coordination called Castaneed.</p>

                <p>With so much buzzing around the use of social media, we believe that tools like Facebook and Twitter can be leveraged to create viral momentum surrounding real-time needs. We have been asked multiple times if our team believes this prototype could be built to handle this type of collaboration on every continent in the world.<br><br>Although our concentration is devoted to creating a successful program in the United States, it would be amazing to see a prototype of this nature being implemented worldwide. Castaneed is devoted to meeting needs and when needs are met the impact could be infinite.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Research and interviews produced case studies that told our team that in almost every instance of disaster the local church and non-profits in the area are always the first responders to supply need. <br><br>Alongside designer and fontographer, Robbie de Villiers and his vision for the identity of the platform- we built Castaneed with a model that would leverage the immediacy of social media, local churches, and non-profits to give people the hands-on task of serving or donating to a specific need. The interface features a map of the United States that will gather serving opportunities and real needs in pursuit of being fulfilled.
